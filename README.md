# Exploring-Analysing-and-Predicting-the-Medal-Winning-Rate-For-History-of-Olympics-Data-1896-2016-
The dataset is about modern Olympic Games, including all the games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016 which provides the information about athletes from different nations, different sports and events.
In this project, our goal is to shed light on major patterns in Olympic history. For example, answering questions like How many athletes, sports, and nations are there, Where do most athletes come from, Who wins medals,What are the characteristics of the athletes e.g., gender and physical size.
Introduction
The cutting-edge Olympic Games are driving worldwide games including summer and winter
sports rivalries in which a huge number of competitors from around the globe take an interest in
an assortment of rivalries. The Olympic Games are viewed as the world's premier games rivalry
within excess of 200 countries taking an interest. The Olympic Games are held at regular intervals,
with the Summer and Winter Games exchanging by happening like clockwork yet two years
separated.
120 years of Olympic data, this dataset is obtained from GitHub repository. A Combination of
several factors like "Name", "Age”, Height", ''Weight”, “Season” , "Sport", “Event" and "Medal"
and a few more are considered for analysis. The dataset consists of 271116 rows and 15 columns.
Each row corresponds to an individual athlete competing in an individual Olympic event (athleteevents). In this project, we are going to preprocess the data and perform some visualizations to
know about the dataset in detail. Implementing Correlation Analysis to show which factors are
influencing the Athlete’s Performance and what would be the important factors we need to
consider for estimating their Losing or Winning the sport in event. Moreover, We are going to use
Machine Learning techniques for better prediction and also descriptive and inferential statistics
for evaluating the accuracy of our prediction. Our proposed model helps in analysing the
Olympic History from the past 120 years and also implementing some inferential statistics with
detailed visualizations. For Analysing this dataset, we are using PySpark and also some Big Data
tools.
